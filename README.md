This script is a handy tool to check if IP addresses are resolvable to domain names and retrieve ASN (Autonomous System Number) information using the APNIC (Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre) database. 🌐

✨ The script prompts you to enter an IP address or a set of IP addresses separated by spaces. It also accepts a file containing a list of IP addresses. 📝

⚡️ Once you provide the IP addresses, the script performs a DNS lookup to determine if each IP address is resolvable to a domain name. If a domain is found, it fetches the corresponding ASN information, including the ASN number and organization. 🌍

📊 The script generates a text file with the IP address, resolved domain name (if available), ASN number, and organization. It also creates a CSV file with headers for easy analysis and data manipulation. 📁

🔍 The script provides a summary at the end, displaying the total number of IP addresses checked, the count of IP addresses with resolved domains, and the count of IP addresses without resolved domains.

🚀 This script is a helpful tool for network administrators, cybersecurity professionals, or anyone interested in investigating IP address connectivity and ownership information. 💡
